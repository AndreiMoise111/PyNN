= Functions =

=== connect(source, target, weight=None, delay=None, synapse_type=None, p=1, rng=None) ===
Connect a source of spikes to a synaptic target. source and target can
both be individual cells or lists of cells, in which case all possible
connections are made with probability p, using either the random number
generator supplied, or the default rng otherwise.
Weights should be in nA or ÂµS.
=== create(cellclass, param_dict=None, n=1) ===
Create n cells all of the same type.
If n > 1, return a list of cell ids/references.
If n==1, return just the single id.
=== distance(src, tgt, mask=None, scale_factor=1.0, offset=0.0, periodic_boundaries=None) ===
Return the Euclidian distance between two cells.
`mask` allows only certain dimensions to be considered, e.g.::
 * to ignore the z-dimension, use `mask=array([0,1])`
 * to ignore y, `mask=array([0,2])`
 * to just consider z-distance, `mask=array([2])`
`scale_factor` allows for different units in the pre- and post- position
(the post-synaptic position is multipied by this quantity).
=== distances(pre, post, mask=None, scale_factor=1.0, offset=0.0, periodic_boundaries=None) ===
Calculate the entire distance matrix at once.
From http://projects.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2007-April/027203.html
=== end(compatible_output=True) ===
Do any necessary cleaning up before exiting.
=== get_current_time() ===
Return the current time in the simulation.
=== get_max_delay() ===

=== get_min_delay() ===

=== get_time_step() ===

=== num_processes() ===

=== rank() ===
Return the MPI rank.
=== record(source, filename) ===
Record spikes to a file. source can be an individual cell or a list of
cells.
=== record_v(source, filename) ===
Record membrane potential to a file. source can be an individual cell or
a list of cells.
=== run(simtime) ===
Run the simulation for simtime ms.
=== set(cells, param, val=None) ===
Set one or more parameters of an individual cell or list of cells.
param can be a dict, in which case val should not be supplied, or a string
giving the parameter name, in which case val is the parameter value.
=== setup(timestep=0.1, min_delay=0.1, max_delay=10.0, debug=False, **extra_params) ===
Should be called at the very beginning of a script.
extra_params contains any keyword arguments that are required by a given
simulator but not by others.

= Core classes =

== Population ==
An array of neurons all of the same type. `Population' is used as a generic
term intended to include layers, columns, nuclei, etc., of cells.
=== !__getitem!__(self, addr) ===
Return a representation of the cell with coordinates given by addr,
suitable for being passed to other methods that require a cell id.
Note that !__getitem!__ is called when using [] access, e.g.
p = Population(...)
p[2,3] is equivalent to p.!__getitem!__((2,3)).
=== !__init!__(self, dims, cellclass, cellparams=None, label=None) ===
dims should be a tuple containing the population dimensions, or a single
integer, for a one-dimensional population.
e.g., (10,10) will create a two-dimensional population of size 10x10.
cellclass should either be a standardized cell class (a class inheriting
from common.!StandardCellType) or a string giving the name of the
simulator-specific model that makes up the population.
cellparams should be a dict which is passed to the neuron model
constructor
label is an optional name for the population.
=== !__iter!__(self) ===
Iterator over cell ids.
=== !__len!__(self) ===
Return the total number of cells in the population.
=== addresses(self) ===
Iterator over cell addresses.
=== describe(self) ===
Returns a human readable description of the population
=== getSpikes(self, gather=True) ===
Return a 2-column numpy array containing cell ids and spike times for
recorded cells.

Useful for small populations, for example for single neuron Monte-Carlo.
=== ids(self) ===
Iterator over cell ids.
=== index(self, n) ===
Return the nth cell in the population (Indexing starts at 0).
=== locate(self, id) ===
Given an element id in a Population, return the coordinates.
e.g. for  4 6  , element 2 has coordinates (1,0) and value 7
7 9
=== meanSpikeCount(self, gather=True) ===
Returns the mean number of spikes per neuron.
=== nearest(self, position) ===
Return the neuron closest to the specified position.
=== printSpikes(self, filename, gather=True, compatible_output=True) ===
Write spike times to file.

If compatible_output is True, the format is "spiketime cell_id",
where cell_id is the index of the cell counting along rows and down
columns (and the extension of that for 3-D).
This allows easy plotting of a `raster' plot of spiketimes, with one
line for each cell.
The timestep, first id, last id, and number of data points per cell are
written in a header, indicated by a '#' at the beginning of the line.

If compatible_output is False, the raw format produced by the simulator
is used. This may be faster, since it avoids any post-processing of the
spike files.

For parallel simulators, if gather is True, all data will be gathered
to the master node and a single output file created there. Otherwise, a
file will be written on each node, containing only the cells simulated
on that node.
=== print_v(self, filename, gather=True, compatible_output=True) ===
Write membrane potential traces to file.

If compatible_output is True, the format is "v cell_id",
where cell_id is the index of the cell counting along rows and down
columns (and the extension of that for 3-D).
The timestep, first id, last id, and number of data points per cell are
written in a header, indicated by a '#' at the beginning of the line.

If compatible_output is False, the raw format produced by the simulator
is used. This may be faster, since it avoids any post-processing of the
voltage files.

For parallel simulators, if gather is True, all data will be gathered
to the master node and a single output file created there. Otherwise, a
file will be written on each node, containing only the cells simulated
on that node.
=== randomInit(self, rand_distr) ===
Set initial membrane potentials for all the cells in the population to
random values.
=== record(self, record_from=None, rng=None) ===
If record_from is not given, record spikes from all cells in the Population.
record_from can be an integer - the number of cells to record from, chosen
at random (in this case a random number generator can also be supplied)
- or a list containing the ids of the cells to record.
=== record_v(self, record_from=None, rng=None) ===
If record_from is not given, record the membrane potential for all cells in
the Population.
record_from can be an integer - the number of cells to record from, chosen
at random (in this case a random number generator can also be supplied)
- or a list containing the ids of the cells to record.
=== rset(self, parametername, rand_distr) ===
'Random' set. Set the value of parametername to a value taken from
rand_distr, which should be a !RandomDistribution object.
=== set(self, param, val=None) ===
Set one or more parameters for every cell in the population. param
can be a dict, in which case val should not be supplied, or a string
giving the parameter name, in which case val is the parameter value.
val can be a numeric value, or list of such (e.g. for setting spike times).
e.g. p.set("tau_m",20.0).
p.set({'tau_m':20,'v_rest':-65})
=== tset(self, parametername, value_array) ===
'Topographic' set. Set the value of parametername to the values in
value_array, which must have the same dimensions as the Population.
'''positions''' = <property object at 0xb6db861c>



== Projection ==
A container for all the connections of a given type (same synapse type and
plasticity mechanisms) between two populations, together with methods to set
parameters of those connections, including of plasticity mechanisms.
=== !__init!__(self, presynaptic_population, postsynaptic_population, method='allToAll', method_parameters=None, source=None, target=None, synapse_dynamics=None, label=None, rng=None) ===
presynaptic_population and postsynaptic_population - Population objects.

source - string specifying which attribute of the presynaptic cell
signals action potentials

target - string specifying which synapse on the postsynaptic cell to
connect to

If source and/or target are not given, default values are used.

method - string indicating which algorithm to use in determining
connections.
Allowed methods are 'allToAll', 'oneToOne', 'fixedProbability',
'distanceDependentProbability', 'fixedNumberPre', 'fixedNumberPost',
'fromFile', 'fromList'.

method_parameters - dict containing parameters needed by the connection
method, although we should allow this to be a number or string if there
is only one parameter.

synapse_dynamics - a `!SynapseDynamics` object specifying which
synaptic plasticity mechanisms to use.

rng - since most of the connection methods need uniform random numbers,
it is probably more convenient to specify a RNG object here rather
than within method_parameters, particularly since some methods also use
random numbers to give variability in the number of connections per cell.

=== describe(self) ===
Returns a human readable description of the projection
=== getDelays(self, format='list', gather=True) ===

Set parameters of the synapse dynamics to values taken from rand_distr
=== randomizeWeights(self, rand_distr) ===
Set weights to random values taken from rand_distr.
=== saveConnections(self, filename, gather=False) ===
Save connections to file in a format suitable for reading in with the
'fromFile' method.

value, or a list/1D array of length equal to the number of connections
in the population.
=== setSynapseDynamics(self, param, value) ===
Set parameters of the synapse dynamics linked with the projection
=== setWeights(self, w) ===
w can be a single number, in which case all weights are set to this
value, or a list/1D array of length equal to the number of connections
in the population.
Weights should be in nA for current-based and ÂµS for conductance-based
synapses.
